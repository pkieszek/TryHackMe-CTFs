# TryHackMe CTF Achievements

## Introduction
This repository showcases my Capture The Flag (CTF) accomplishments on TryHackMe. CTF competitions test and enhance cybersecurity skills through hands-on challenges in penetration testing, cryptography, forensics, and more.

## What is a CTF?
Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions are cybersecurity challenges designed to test and improve hacking skills. Participants solve challenges involving:
- Cryptography
- Web Exploitation
- Forensics
- Reverse Engineering
- Privilege Escalation
